          <h1>RAM in Shadertoy</h1>
          <p>
            Recently (in early January
            2016), <a href="http://shadertoy.com">Shadertoy</a>
            released a new multipass system. This system allows a user
            to write multiple shaders and sample them as needed. One
            of the most basic procedures that can be applied with
            persistent-state buffers is blurring, but
            really, <em>any</em> state can be saved and retreived in
            the fragment shader. This can be applied to do lots of
            cool things, including making games.
          </p>
          <p>
            This article aims to show how to use Shadertoy's buffer
            feature in order to store arbitrary data. Note that data
            needs to be stored in pixel format, which is based on
            floating point numbers.

          <h4>Allocating "RAM"</h4>
          <p>
            Part of these new buffers can be used as general purpose
            floating point RAM. Allocating this buffer is as simple as
            using a new buffer. In your fragment shader,
            set <code>ichannel0</code> to be Buffer A, then press the
            plus sign at the top of the editor and add Buffer A.

          <h4>Variable Declaration</h4>
          <p>
            All variables are going to need to be declared at compile
            time. This is a little limiting if you're used to using
            Java or something like that with dynamic allocation, but
            with practice it isn't so bad. Variables are going to be
            accessed by a number as well, but the method described in
            this article allows for up to 16384 floating point
            variables to be stored in each buffer.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we need to build a way to convert 1D indices to 2D
            coordinates. This is because each of our RAM cells exists
            in a pixel buffer. The following function converts a 1D
            index to a 2D coordinate, and should be used in both
            Buffer A and the image fragment shader.

          <p>
            Note that RAM_SIZE should be a constant float, usually
            defined in the preprocessor, that should be less than both
            the width and height of the shader (Otherwise, the buffer
            will probably be too small to use it all).

          <h4>Initializing RAM</h4>
          <p>
            Now that we have a way to convert RAM 1D coordinates to a
            Buffer location, we can start to initialize the variables
            we need. Let's say that we want to hold a variable at
            location <code>345.0</code>, and initialize it to a value
            of <code>0.5</code>. Well, for each variable, we'll need
            the following in the <code>mainImage</code> method of our
            Buffer A:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <pre id="glslInclude2" class="sh_glsl"></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <p>
            Note that this block, starting with the
            first <code>if</code> statement, must be repeated for each
            variable needed in RAM.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <h4>Reading RAM</h4>
          <p>
            Now that you have some RAM initialized, you can read it in
            the image fragment shader with the following code:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <pre id="glslInclude3" class="sh_glsl"></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <p>
            This should be used in the image fragment shader, but
            should also be used in the Buffer A shader as well. This
            is really the trick to this whole procedure, as we need to
            write the persistent state back to Buffer A if it does not
            change. So, we'll change our <code>mainImage</code> method
            to:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <pre id="glslInclude4" class="sh_glsl"></pre>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <h4>Updating RAM</h4>
          <p>
            Now that we're able to read the values in RAM, it helps to
            update values in RAM as well. This is going to be done in
            the <code>mainImage</code> method of the Buffer A shader
            as well (because this is really the only place where an
            update of this state can happen). The following code shows
            how this can be accomplished:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <pre id="glslInclude5" class="sh_glsl"></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12">
          <h4>Next Steps</h4>
          <p>
            Now that persistent data can be stored in a shader, it is
            pretty easy to make games with a fragment shader. Although
            it's a little out of the ordinary to initialize, read, and
            update variables like this, it works well and allows
            arbitrary data to be stored in a render buffer. The next
            steps are really up to you!
